          <h2>And because of that, the world has seen a huge impact on mental health.</h2>
           <p>We understand that everyone, from all ages and backgrounds, has had their mental health impacted from the ongoing effects of COVID-19.</p>
           <p>So, to try and help this, we're working with Adhar Project, a mental health charity based in Leicester, to try and support some groups who are struggling with their
            mental health and raise some awareness of the issues they're facing. </p></div>

           <h1>Children's Mental Health Week</h1> 
            <p>This year,<strong> Children's Mental Health Week </strong> is from the 1st February - 7th February. <a href="https://www.place2be.org.uk/">Place2Be</a>, the charity who organised the week, will be raising awareness 
              for Children's Mental Health and finding ways online to get the community involved to help raise awareness.
            </p>
            <p>The theme of Children's Mental Health Week is <strong>"Express Yourself"</strong>, so we're going to be doing our best to encourage everyone, regardless of age or background, to share your 
              thoughts and feelings through your unique creativity, and to do activities that help your mood.</p> </div>

             <h1>Why do we need to raise awareness?</h1>
            <p>Studies from July 2020 have found; </p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>1/6 children and young people have a diagnosable mental health condition</strong> (this has increased from 1/9 in 2017);</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1/2 of those with lifetime mental health issues first experience symptoms by the age of 14.</strong></p></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>With the ongoing affects of COVID-19 causing challenges to childrens education, home and social life, these trends are only likely to get worse.</strong></p>

            <h1>What are we doing to help?</h1><br>
            <p>On behalf of Adhar, we're going to take control of their social media pages from the <strong>1st - 7th February 2021</strong> for <strong>Children's Mental Health Week</strong>.</p>
           <p>We'll be using their platforms to spread awareness messages about the current issues that children across the country are experiencing and suggesting ways to solve them, whilst also ensuring
             that we spread some awareness for the parents looking after these children too.
