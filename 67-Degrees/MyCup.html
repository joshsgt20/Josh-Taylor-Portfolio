<h2>About 67&#176; Degrees</h2>

<p>67&#176; Degrees was found in 2009 by our founder, Josh Taylor. After being a barista in his youth,
  he found that he had a great love of coffee and began dreaming of opening his own cafe in the future. Therfore,
  after having a successful career of being a Web Developer, he opened his first store in Leicester. Since then, the nation has
  grown to love the coffee, service and attention to detail that is always seen with any 67&#176; Degrees store.</p>.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">How was coffee first discovered?</h2>
<div class="container" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">


    <p class="StyledParagraph">
      The legend of coffees discovery dates back to the 11th century, where a farmer found that one of his goats began
      acting very energetic after eating berries from a 'coffea arabica' tree. The farmer himself tried some of the berries, finding himself to
      have the same energetic feel. The coffee berries were then took to religious leaders, who (after some convincing) put them into hot water, leading to
      the drinks discovery.

    It wasn't until the 15th century that coffee was widely accepted by society, as it was believed to be a drink made from the
    devil. However, soon coffee found its way across the world, with England and other countries discovering it in the 17th discovery,
    gradually transforming it into the drink we all know and love today.
