            <div style="grid-area: Text">
                <p>I'm Josh Taylor, a young and enthusiastic university graduate who has now began a career in web design.</p>
                <p>I pride myself on always ensuring to put as much effort as possible into everything I do - whether this be university, different job roles or 
                    personal experiences. I love to try new things as often as possible, which is why I always make the most out of every experience so that I can 
                    continue to grow and learn something new.
                </p>
                <p>As of May 2021, I have completed my degree at De Montfort University, where I have achieved a <strong>
                    First-Class Honours (BSc)</strong> in Media Production.</p>

                <div class="Text2" style="grid-area: Text2;">
                    <p>During my time on the course, I've learnt new skills and gained experience on a wide range of media forms, including front-end web design, social media marketing, video editing and production, photography,
                        audio production and TV production.</p>
<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
<p>Out of the modules that I specialised in during my final two years of my degree, I found that I enjoyed <strong>social media marketing</strong> the most, and often found that my campaigns proved to be very effective.</p>
<p>I have always found it important to follow a career that you enjoy, so would now like to follow a career in marketing. I believe my skills and work ethic will be effective for the marketing role,
     and this career be something that I will continue to be motivated in and want to develop in.

            <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
            <div class="Interests">
<p style="grid-area: InterestsText">
Besides everything web-related, in my personal life I enjoy to spend time with my family and friends and to be outdoors. I really enjoy "doing something" and easily
get bored the longer that I'm stuck inside or following the same routine, and love the opportunity to do something new.

</p>

<p style="grid-area: CoffeeText"><strong>Coffee</strong><br>
    Since my time working at Starbucks I rely on coffee on a daily basis, but also love to go to different, unique cafes to complete some work. It's also my long term 
    goal to open my own cafe one day.
</p>
<img src="Images\Collesseum.jpg" alt="" style="grid-area: InterestsTravel">
<p style="grid-area: TravellingText"><strong>Travelling</strong><br>
    Going to new places is something that really excites me, and travelling is one of the best ways to achieve that. So far I've been to China, Italy and the USA, but I'm 
    planning on growing that list throughout my life.</p>
    <img src="Images\Coffee Picture.jpg" alt="" style="grid-area: InterestsCoffee">

    <p style="grid-area: ZeusText"><strong>My Dog</strong><br>
        Zeus, my German Shepherd, is someone who is always happy to follow me wherever I go. He's my favourite companion for anything and gives me an excuse to go for long walks every day, 
        and to find out new places to discover together.
