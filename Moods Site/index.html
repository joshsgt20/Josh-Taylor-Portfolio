          <h2>This past year has seen the biggest impact on student mental health than any year before.</h2>
           <p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, students have had to face a new way of learning that no previous 
             years of university students have experienced before. <br>
             <strong>And if we're honest, it really hasn't been good enough.</strong><br>
             Students have been left to feel forgotten - overlooked by the government with the many announcements for new rules and lockdown measures.
             <br><strong>And now, with over 2.3 million students currently studying in UK universities, students are on the brink of facing a mental health crisis.</strong>
                       </p></div>

           <h1>University Mental Health Day</h1> 
            <p>On Thursday 4th March, 2021, it's <strong> University Mental Health Day</strong>, and we're going to be joining in to campaign to make 
              mental health a university-wide priority, so that students now, and in the future, have better access for support.</p>
              <p>Even before COVID-19, <strong> mental health issues with students were on a steep rise</strong>, due to feeling extreme stress and anxiety 
                from academic, social and financial presures, each causing an increasing amount of students suffering from mental health difficulties. </p>
            <p><strong>And after around one year of being in-and-out of lockdowns, students mental health took an even larger toll.</strong></p>

             <h1>What makes university mental health day so important?</h1>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that out of the 2.3 million students in UK universities;</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Before COVID-19 struck, 1/2 students had experienced such impactful depression</strong> that they felt it was very difficult to function;</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Since then, 3/4 students have said their mental health has worsened</strong> since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic;</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>3/5 students have said they have had to ask for support during the pandemic</strong>, and 40% of those said it was very difficult to receive it;</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>And with all of these increases in mental health problems, students are being left to feel forgotten and given no choice other than to continue the way they're forced to - 
                even further increasing problems with mental health.

          <p>This content is coming from someone who is a current university student, so you can count on it being an accurate representation of how students across the country are feeling.

              <h1>What are we doing to help?</h1><br>
              <p>On behalf of Adhar, we're going to take control of their social media pages from the <strong>1st - 7th March 2021</strong> for <strong>University Mental Health Day</strong>.</p>
             <p>It's important to ensure that students know that they're not alone with these problems, and that support is readily available for anyone who may need it. This awareness was important to raise
               a year ago, before anyone had even heard of coronavirus. However, since the start of various lockdown measures, students mental health has deteriorated across the country, and support is needed now more than ever.
