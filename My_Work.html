        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>Since starting at DMU, I've been able to complete multiple projects for digtal design - creating websites that have increased in their complexity, and creating 
          wireframes and prototypes for UI projects. 
          
        </p>
        <p>This has allowed me to complete some projects for organisations on a freelance basis, which is something I'm always open to.</p>

<h1>UI/UX Design</h1>

<p>Here are some examples of some prototypes of apps I've created during my time at university. These have all been designed on InVision, and have 
  both had a full design process - from wireframes and mood boards to a functional prototype.
</p>

</div>
<div style="grid-area: MoodsText" id="MoodsUI">
 
<h2>Moods.</h2>
    <p>Moods. is a progressive web application that was designed from wireframes, to prototype and finally to a functioning website.</p>
    <p>It's purpose is to be a mental health companion app, which people can use to find support for <strong>anxiety</strong>, <strong>stress</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong>,
      <strong>anger</strong>, and <strong>happiness</strong>. It provides information and advice for those who may be suffering from the listed problems, and also features built-in 
    applications to help them - such as a <strong>to-do app</strong>, <strong>meditation app</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, and more.</p>

<h2>Student Links</h2> 
<p>Student Links is a complete prototype that I designed on InVision, which was created for one of my assignments to create a unique application that 
  would be useful.
</p>
<p>The app is designed to offer support and guidance to university students in their city. It provides <strong>support</strong> for student living and health, <strong>locations</strong> of things to do and places students may need, <strong>social media 
  competitions</strong> that encourage healthy living and budgeting, and a <strong>student forum</strong>, which allows students to offer suggestions for the app and find further support.

          built-in applications, such as a <strong>to-do list</strong> which uses <strong>local storage</strong>, a <strong>weather app</strong> which uses <strong>API</strong> and more.

        <h2>Awareness Sites</h2>
        <p>These two sites were created as part of my Technology Project (otherwide known as a dissertation) at DMU.</p>
        <p>Overall these sites are relatively basic, using a less JavaScript, but plenty of HTML and CSS to ensure they're fully adaptive to screen size. These sites were combined with <strong>social media campaign</strong>
          to help raise awareness of <strong>Children's Mental Health</strong> and <strong>University Student Mental Health</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This project was successful in raising awareness and allowed me to focus on ensuring the site was fully functional over creating something with lots of built-in features, although I did have to ensure each site 
          had something extra to make it <strong>stand out</strong>.

        <h2>Adhar Project</h2>
        <p>This site was my first ever freelance project, where I was tasked with re-creating Adhar Project's website.</p>
        <p>Adhar's previous website was extremely outdated and created using an old web-design platform, so I completely coded the site 
          from scratch and followed their desired design.
        </p>
        <p>The charity didn't want any fancy features or a particularly bold design, they just wanted an simple, informational site that was good 
          for their audience.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless, this project helped me learn new skills and ways to learn independently, and I have since been able to develop my knowledge of 
          codiing far beyond this.

        <p>Before this, I had only made sites that would not fit mobiles properly, or that didn't feature anything

                <h1>Social Media Work</h1>
                <p>Another module that I've had interest in at DMU is social media - campaigning online for different organisations to either help raise awareness or promote  something.</p>
                <p>I will often create graphics to post online that are able to achieve this, mostly using Adobe Illustrator to do so.</p>

    <h2 id="AwarenessMedia">Awareness Campaign</h2>
    <p>Alongside the two websites for <strong>University Mental Health</strong> and <strong>Children's Mental Health</strong>, I performed two social media campaigns to help promote the websites 
    and raise awareness.</p>
<p>Both campaigns were posted on Adhar Project's social media profiles, as I wanted to make a lasting impact on a charity organisation and give the audiece somewhere to find support. </p>
<p>For each campaign I created mutliple graphics on Illustrator to post so that I could cover a large amount of content, and ensured to use every feature of the social media sites that were used.</p>

                <h2>Other Projects</h2>
                <p>I have also completed other social media work for both university projects and freelance projects.</p>
                <p>At Uni, I completed a campaign for the DMU Theatre Society, where I took control of their social media accounts to promote their upcoming events.</p>
                <p>For freelance; I've created multiple graphics and posters, to both raise awareness and promote upcoming events, for Adhar Project and South Asian Health Action - both leicester based charities.</p>
