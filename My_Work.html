        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>Since starting at DMU, I've been able to complete multiple projects for digtal design - creating websites that have increased in their complexity, and creating 
          wireframes and prototypes for UI projects. 
          
        </p>
        <p>This has allowed me to complete some projects for organisations on a freelance basis, which is something I'm always open to.</p>

<h1 style="grid-area: UITitle">UI/UX Design</h1>

<p style="grid-area: UIText">Here are some examples of some prototypes of apps I've created during my time at university. These have all been designed on InVision, and have 
  both had a full design process - from wireframes and mood boards to a functional prototype.
</p>


<div style="grid-area: MoodsText">
 
<h2>Moods.</h2>
    <p>Moods. is a progressive web application that was designed from wireframes, to prototype and finally to a functioning website.</p>
    <p>It's purpose is to be a mental health companion app, which people can use to find support for <strong>anxiety</strong>, <strong>stress</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong>,
      <strong>anger</strong>, and <strong>happiness</strong>. It provides information and advice for those who may be suffering from the listed problems, and also features built-in 
    applications to help them - such as a <strong>to-do app</strong>, <strong>meditation app</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, and more.</p>

    <img src="Images\Moods. Cover-01.png" class="MoodsImage" alt=""> </a>

<div style="grid-area: LinksText">
<h2>Student Links</h2> 
<p>Student Links is a complete prototype that I designed on InVision, which was created for one of my assignments to create a unique application that 
  would be useful.
</p>
<p>The app is designed to offer support and guidance to university students in their city. It provides <strong>support</strong> for student living and health, <strong>locations</strong> of things to do and places students may need, <strong>social media 
  competitions</strong> that encourage healthy living and budgeting, and a <strong>student forum</strong>, which allows students to offer suggestions for the app and find further support.

    <section class="Websites">
        <h1>Websites</h1>
        <p>These show some of the websites that I have created for both university and for different organisations as freelance projects.</p>
        <p>All of these sites <strong>(including this portfolio site)</strong> have been coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be fully functional on any device, with a 
          good design and an easy UI.
        </p>


        <h2>Moods. Site</h2>
        <p>This site was created after the orignal design of its prototype.</p>
        <p>It is designed as a progressive web application, so features a slightly different UI design to my other sites, as well as featuring multiple, 
          built-in applications, such as a <strong>to-do list</strong> which uses <strong>local storage</strong>, a <strong>weather app</strong> which uses <strong>API</strong> and more.
        </p>
        <button><h2 style="padding: 0;">Moods Website</h2></button>

        <h2>Children's and University Mental Health - Awareness Sites</h2>
        <p>These two sites were created as part of my Technology Project (otherwide known as a dissertation) at DMU.</p>
        <p>Overall these sites are relatively basic, using a less JavaScript, but plenty of HTML and CSS to ensure they're fully adaptive to screen size. These sites were combined with <strong>social media campaign</strong>
          to help raise awareness of <strong>Children's Mental Health</strong> and <strong>University Student Mental Health</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This project was successful in raising awareness and allowed me to focus on ensuring the site was fully functional over creating something with lots of built-in features, although I did have to ensure each site 
          had something extra to make it <strong>stand out</strong>.
        </p>
<button><h2 style="padding: 0;">Children's Mental Health Site Website</h2></button>

<button><h2 style="padding: 0;">University Mental Health Website</h2></button>

        <h2>Adhar Project</h2>
        <p>This site was my first ever freelance project, where I was tasked with re-creating Adhar Project's website.</p>
        <p>Adhar's previous website was extremely outdated and created using an old web-design platform, so I completely coded the site 
          from scratch and followed their desired design.
        </p>
        <p>The charity didn't want any fancy features or a particularly bold design, they just wanted an simple, informational site that was good 
          for their audience.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless, this project helped me learn new skills and ways to learn independently, and I have since been able to develop my knowledge of 
          codiing far beyond this.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Heads</h2>

        <h2>67 Degrees</h2>
        <p>This is what I would class as my first website - a coffee shop site created for one of my coursework projects. I got to choose the topic and contents of the site,
          and wanted to test myself to my ability at an early stage of coding.
        </p>
        <p>Before this, I had only made sites that would not fit mobiles properly, or that didn't feature anything 
          too complex. However, after this site, I was able to start coding properly and began to understand what you can achieve with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
        </p>
