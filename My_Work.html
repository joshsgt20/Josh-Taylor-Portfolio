        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>Since starting at DMU, I've been able to complete multiple projects for digtal design - creating multiple websites, designing online campaigns and creating 
          wireframes and prototypes for UI projects. 
          
        </p>
        <p>This has allowed me to complete some projects for organisations on a freelance basis, which is something I'm always open to.</p>
        <p>I have also began to gain experience whilst working at <a href="https://www.rawnet.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwub-HBhCyARIsAPctr7wn7nHKjbHD22iezEC5mivvKyNOu3uEZDL34XdWOIaWWkMzsKKvN4gaAov_EALw_wcB">

            <h1>Technology Project</h1>
            <p>My final year project at DMU was an opportunity for me to show my skills and knowledge I had learned at DMU, so I wanted to ensure it was impactful and long lasting.</p>

             <p>To do so, I completed two, separate social media campaigns on behalf of a Leicester based charity. For each campaign, I designed and coded separate websites and multiple graphics to be posted on the charityâ€™s social media platforms.
                These results were then analysed thoroughly to find the most successful.
               </p>
    </section>


    <section class="SocialMediaWork">
      <h1>Social Media Marketing</h1>
      <p>At University, I specialised in <strong>social media marketing / campaigning </strong>- learning the theory behind social media and its massive influence in todays society,
        whilst also being able to gain experience by completing multiple online campaigns different organisations, to either help raise awareness or to promote events.</p>
        <p>These campaigns have always been completed independently and involve a high amount of planning to be complete. On reflection, these can be narrowed down into four main stages
          <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Planning</strong> - Finding what will work best, the type of content that I will post and it's schedule.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Designing</strong> - Design various types of content that relates to the goal of the campaign using Adobe Creative Cloud.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Campaigning</strong> - The actual campaigning process, ensuring that all posts are released on time and that I am interacting with the audience.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Reflection</strong> - Here I reflect on the outcomes, analyse the statistics and give feedback to the organisation in order to improve going forward.</p></li>
          </l>
        </p>
   
<h2 id="AwarenessMedia">Awareness Campaign</h2>
<p>Alongside the two websites for <strong>University Mental Health</strong> and <strong>Children's Mental Health</strong>, I performed two social media campaigns to help promote the websites 
and raise awareness.</p>
<p>Both campaigns were posted on Adhar Project's social media profiles, as I wanted to make a lasting impact on a charity organisation and give the audiece somewhere to find support. </p>
<p>For each campaign I created mutliple graphics on Illustrator to post so that I could cover a large amount of content, and ensured to use every feature of the social media sites that were used.</p>

      <h2>Other Projects</h2>
      <p>I have also completed other social media work for both university projects and freelance projects.</p>
      <p>At Uni, I completed a campaign for the DMU Theatre Society, where I took control of their social media accounts to promote their upcoming events.</p>
      <p>For freelance; I've created multiple graphics and posters, to both raise awareness and promote upcoming events, for Adhar Project and South Asian Health Action - both leicester based charities.</p>

        <h1>Websites</h1>
        <p>These show some of the websites that I have created for both university and for different organisations as freelance projects.</p>
        <p>All of these sites <strong>(including this portfolio site)</strong> have been coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be fully functional on any device, with the aim of

<p>This is one of my most recent, personal projects, that was created in order to learn, and demonstate, how to build a functional, secure,
   ecommerce store.

</p>

<p>The site uses SnipCart, an online store API that ensures all orders are encrypted and validated, removing the risk of fraudulent activity. The site is 
  also created to be both responsive, and functional, so that users are able to easily find their desired product.
</p>

<p>This site is made to be an example, so additional features and functionality could be added upon request.</p>

        <p>These two sites were created as part of my Technology Project (otherwide known as a dissertation) at DMU.</p>
        <p>Overall these sites are relatively basic, using a less JavaScript, but plenty of HTML and CSS to ensure they're fully adaptive to screen size. These sites were combined with <strong>social media campaign</strong>
          to help raise awareness of <strong>Children's Mental Health</strong> and <strong>University Student Mental Health</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This project was successful in raising awareness and allowed me to focus on ensuring the site was fully functional over creating something with lots of built-in features.

        <h2>Adhar Project</h2>
        <p>This site was my first ever freelance project, where I was tasked with re-creating Adhar Project's website.</p>
        <p>Adhar's previous website was extremely outdated and created using an old web-design platform, so I completely coded the site 
          from scratch and followed their desired design.
        </p>
        <p>The charity didn't want any fancy features or a particularly bold design, they just wanted an simple, informational site that was good 
          for their audience.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless, this project helped me learn new skills and ways to learn independently, and I have since been able to develop my knowledge of 
          codiing far beyond this.
